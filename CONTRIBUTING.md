# Contributing to MCU-Sim

First off, thank you for considering contributing to MCU-Sim! Your help is appreciated. This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to the project.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in various forms, including:

*   Reporting bugs
*   Suggesting enhancements or new features
*   Submitting pull requests for code changes or documentation improvements

## Getting Started

*   **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
*   **Clone your fork** locally: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/MCU-Sim.git`
*   **Create a new branch** for your changes: `git checkout -b your-branch-name` (e.g., `fix/component-bug` or `feature/new-component`).
*   Refer to the [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md) document for project-specific coding and structural conventions.

## Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug, please create an issue on GitHub. When reporting a bug, please include:

*   A clear and descriptive title.
*   Steps to reproduce the bug.
*   Expected behavior.
*   Actual behavior.
*   Screenshots or videos if applicable.
*   Your operating system, Godot version, and any relevant hardware information.

## Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for an enhancement or a new feature, please create an issue on GitHub. Describe your suggestion in detail, including:

*   A clear and descriptive title.
*   The problem or use case your enhancement addresses.
*   A detailed description of the proposed enhancement or feature.
*   Any potential benefits or drawbacks.

**Important:** Before starting work on a new feature or significant change, please ensure an issue has been created and accepted by the maintainers. This helps prevent duplicate efforts and ensures your contribution aligns with the project's goals.

## Pull Request Process

1.  **Ensure your changes adhere to [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md).**
2.  **Work on an accepted issue/suggestion:** Pull requests should generally be linked to an existing and approved issue or suggestion. If you're unsure, please discuss your proposed changes in an issue first.
3.  **Commit your changes** with clear and concise commit messages.
4.  **Push your changes** to your forked repository: `git push origin your-branch-name`.
5.  **Open a pull request** to the `main` branch of the original MCU-Sim repository.
6.  Provide a clear description of the changes in your pull request, linking to the relevant issue (e.g., "Fixes #123").
7.  Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. Be prepared to address any feedback or make further changes.

## Coding Conventions

All contributions must adhere to the guidelines outlined in the [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md) file. This includes scene structure, GDScript style, naming conventions, and more.

## Use of AI-Generated Code

The use of AI-assisted tools for generating code or documentation is permitted. However, it comes with important responsibilities:

*   **Increased Scrutiny Required:** AI-generated code must be subject to **further scrutiny and meticulous manual review** compared to manually written code. This is due to the nature of AI, including the potential for "hallucinations" (generating incorrect or nonsensical output) or subtle bugs that may not be immediately obvious.
*   **Full Responsibility:** You, the contributor, are fully responsible for any code you submit, regardless of whether it was written manually or generated by AI.
*   **Understanding and Testing:** You must thoroughly understand any AI-generated code you submit. Ensure it is correct, adheres to project conventions, and is adequately tested.
*   **Indicate AI Use:** Clearly indicate in your pull request if significant portions of the code were AI-generated. This transparency helps reviewers apply the appropriate level of scrutiny.

### Recommended AI Tools

Tools that allow the contributor (and reviewers) to easily read, understand, and verify the generated code are preferred. Examples include:

*   **Aider:** (Command-line tool that works with local files)
*   **Cursor:** (IDE with integrated AI features)
*   **Copy-pasting from online web chats:** (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) where the generated code is visible and can be directly inspected and modified.

### Non-Recommended AI Tools

Tools that obscure the generated code, make it difficult to review step-by-step, or automate changes without clear visibility are generally not recommended for contributions. This is because they can make the review process harder and may introduce changes that are not well understood by the contributor. Examples of tools that might fall into this category (depending on their specific usage and features) include:

*   Roo.code
*   Cline
*   Blackbox IDE (if primarily used for opaque code generation)
*   Kilo.code
*   Replit Agent (if changes are automated without clear review)
*   Bolt.DIY

The key principle is **transparency and reviewability**. If an AI tool helps you write better code that you fully understand and can vouch for, it's likely acceptable. If it obscures the process or generates code you don't understand, it's best to avoid using it for contributions.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by a Code of Conduct (to be added - for now, please be respectful and considerate in all interactions). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior.

## Questions?

If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue or reach out to the maintainers.
