## 4. Software Engineering Practices

*   **Modular Design:**
    *   Each electronic component is a self-contained scene and script, promoting reusability and maintainability.
    *   Separation of concerns (e.g., `CircuitEditor3D` for UI and interaction, `CircuitGraph` for simulation logic).
*   **Code Organization:**
    *   Following naming conventions (see `CONVENTIONS.md`).
    *   Structuring scripts with clear functions and variable names.
*   **Debugging:**
    *   Using `print()`, `printerr()`, and `print_debug()` for tracing execution and diagnosing issues.
*   **Version Control:**
    *   The project is managed with Git, as indicated by `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes`. Understanding these files is part of using version control effectively.
*   **Defensive Programming:**
    *   Checks for node validity (`is_instance_valid()`) before use.
    *   Error handling and logging (`printerr`).
    *   Input validation for user-editable fields.

## 5. Mathematics in Simulation

*   **Linear Algebra:** The core of the MNA solver involves setting up and solving a system of linear equations (Ax=b).
*   **Basic Calculus Concepts:**
    *   The models for capacitors (I = C * dV/dt) and inductors (V = L * dI/dt) are based on derivatives, which are approximated using discrete time steps in the simulation (e.g., dV/dt â‰ˆ (Vc(t) - Vc(t-dt)) / delta_t).
